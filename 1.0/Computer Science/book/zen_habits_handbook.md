# Zen Habits: Handbook for Life

Leo Babauta of [Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.com) fame put together this collection of best
articles. It's about living simply, being productive, and being happy. I think this made a great
companion to "Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy".

# Simplicity

**Decluttering**

Simplify the physical things in life by decluttering your home. Take everything out of the
shelf/drawer and sort it through three piles: trash, give away, keep. Try to be merciless.

**Single-tasking**

Don't juggle (tasks) like the Ringling Bros. Multi-tasking is less efficient and more complicated.

Instead, work on your most important tasks first thing in the morning. Turn off distractions like
the internet or cell phones. Focus but take breaks every now and then.

**Edit Your Commitments**

Edit your life - cut out everything that's not necessary to make it more meaningful.

List out all the commitments you have. Now ask yourself if it's important, if it will further your
life goals, is it in line with your priorities?

Some common categories: work, side work, family, kids, civic, religious, hobbies, home, and online.

Take time to edit your commitments to greatly simplify your life.

**Eliminate All but the Essentials**

You've got a long list of projects and tasks that will never be done. Identify the essential and
eliminate the rest.

- eliminate tasks and projects - know what's essential - simplify your commitments - simplify your
information streams (RSS, newspapers, TV, blogs, etc...) - identify and accomplish the big rocks -
go for biggest values instead of quantity - batch small tasks

**Declutter Your Mind**

Some tips for decluttering the mind:

1. breathe
2. write it down
3. identify the essential
4. eliminate
5. journal
6. rethink sleep
7. take a walk
8. watch less TV
9. get in touch with nature
10. do less
11. go slower
12. let go
13. declutter surroundings
14. single-task
15. get a load off (talk to friends)

# Productivity

**Purpose Your Day: Most Important Tasks**

Your MIT is the task you most want or need to get done today. In Leo's case, he has three MITs
everyday which he does first thing in the morning. Get them out of the way and feel accomplished for
the rest of the day.

**Focus on the Big Rocks**

The Big Rocks are what you want to get done most this week. Leo suggests getting these out of the
way early in the days. Then fill in the rest of the day with sand/pebbles - the smaller tasks that
need to get done but aren't as important.

**Clear Out Your Inbox**

This is the same concept as Inbox Zero, delete your email as they come in.

Don't check email first thing in the morning. When you do, dispose of it right away. Have only one
folder: "Archive".

**Clear Your Desk**

Have a clear desk except for the one thing you're working on.

Take everything on/in your desk and process them: trash it, delegate it, file it, do it. Do this
daily to keep your desk clear.

**Become an Early Riser**

Leo has a habit of waking up at 4:30AM every morning. This has a few benefits:

1. Let's you greet the day
2. Let's you have a slow start instead of a morning rush
3. Quietude
4. Enjoy the sunrise
5. Have time for breakfast
6. Get exercise
7. Productive due to no distractions
8. Goal time
9. Easier commute
10. Easier early appointments

**Become Motivated When You're in a Slump**

Some things to help during a slump:

1. Have _One Goal_
2. Find inspiration
3. Get excited from your inspiration and _One Goal_
4. Post your goal and commit publicly
5. Think about it daily
6. Get support
7. Think about benefits instead of difficulties

# Happiness

**Cultivate Compassion in Your Life**

> Compassion is an emotion that is a sense of shared suffering, most often
> combined with a desire to alleviate or reduce suffering of another.

> Compassion differs from other forms of helpful or humane behavior in that its
> focus is primarily on the alleviation of suffering.

1. Have a morning ritual, be happy that you're alive and state your goals to be compassionate.
2. Practice empathy. Imagine the pain others are suffering.
3. Practice commonalities. Imagine what you have in common with others instead of what's different.
4. Practice relief. After imagining inflicting suffering of others onto yourself, reflect on how
   happy you would be to alleviate it.
5. Practice kindness. Do something kind to relieve the suffering of others.
6. Practice for those who mistreat us. Imagine what suffering they went through when they mistreated
   us. Imagine the background of that person. Imagine the commonalities you have. Be kind to them.
7. Have an evening ritual, think about those you've met and how you've connected with them. Did you
   help or hinder?

**Escape Materialism**

Money can't buy you love or happiness. Some tips to escape materialism:

- limit television - eschew the news - limit internet reading - give up magazines for books - don't
go to the mall or department stores - monitor your urges - use a 30-day list - declutter - find
other forms of entertainment - buy used

**Practical Tips for Living the Golden Rule**

Treat others as you want to be treated.

1. Practice empathy
2. Practice compassion
3. Think about how you would want to be treated
4. Be friendly
5. Be helpful
6. Listen to others
7. Overcome prejudice
8. Stop criticism
9. Rise above retaliation
10. Be the change you want to see in the world

**Accept Criticism with Grace and Appreciation**

Stop your first reaction to criticism. Take a breath and give it a bit of thought.

Look for the positive within the criticism. Is it advice that you should listen to?

Thank the critic for good advice or for his/her time.

Now learn from the criticism and become a better person.

**Have Faith in Humanity and Restore Kindness**

Anonymity has created a society which is mean sometimes. We're mean in our cars in traffic and we're
mean on online boards.

Leo has faith in humanity though. There are people out there who do random acts of kindness just to
be nice. Try to pay it forward.

**Boost Your Self-Confidence**

Some tips:

1. Groom yourself
2. Dress nicely
3. Photoshop your self-image
4. Think positive
5. Kill negative thoughts
6. Be kind and generous
7. Be prepared
8. Know your principles and live by them
9. Focus on solutions
10. Smile
11. Volunteer
12. Be grateful
13. Exercise
14. Empower yourself with knowledge

**Live Your Life Consciously**

Living consciously means controlling life, thinking about decisions, and not settling.

It's simple: be conscious and think about everything you do. Make conscious choices instead of doing
without thinking.

Some more tips:

1. Reflect on your life once in a while
2. At least once a year, review life's goals and relationships
3. Consider your impact on the world
4. Consider real costs of stuff
5. Review how you spend your time
