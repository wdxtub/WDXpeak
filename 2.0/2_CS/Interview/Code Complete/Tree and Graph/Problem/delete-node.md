# Delete Node in a Linked List

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

## Complexity

时间复杂度 O(1)，空间复杂度 O(1)

## Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        ListNode next = node.next;
        node.val = next.val;
        node.next = next.next;
    }
}
```
