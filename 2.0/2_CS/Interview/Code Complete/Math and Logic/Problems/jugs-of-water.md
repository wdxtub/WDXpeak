# Jugs of Water

You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, andn an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

## Solution

1. Fill 3, into 5. 3/5, 0/3
2. Fill 3, into 5. 5/5, 1/3
3. Clear 5, 3 into 5. 1/5, 0/3
4. Fill 3, into 5. 4/5, 0/3
