WDXpeak Note
===========

I'm planning to migrate all my note to github. I can not stand the evernote anymore -> huge, slow, ugly. I want an elegant way to note my life.

Evernote is a great tool to collect and connect to the word. But not a good tool to build links within. So It's time to change!

不要导入，整理并思考，完整的复制没有意义，有目的收集才是正道
